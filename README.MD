Rules:

1) You have three darts which you can throw at number 1 through 20

2) A single hit can have a single, double or triple score

E.g. you can hit: single 20 = 20 points or double 20 = 40 points or triple 20 = 60 points

3) In one turn, you can score a maximum of 180 points (3x triple 20 = 3*60 = 180). Anything higher than 180 is impossible. This doesn't mean anything below 180 IS possible. 179 for example, is impossible as well, because the next best score is triple20+triple20+triple19 = 167

4) Normally, you start at 501, and you throw 3 darts, untill you have exactly 0 points left.

5) Now, in Double Out, it is required that the last dart hits a Double

E.g. if you have 180 points left, you cannot finish, because your last dart has to be a double. So the maximum (with ignoring the bulls eye) = triple20 + triple20 + double20 = 160 And if your score is 16, you can simply finish using 1 dart by hitting the double 8. Another example, if your score is 61, you can hit triple17 + double5 (= 51 + 10)
