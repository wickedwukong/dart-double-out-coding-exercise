Rules:

1) You have three darts which you can throw at number 1 through 20

2) A single hit can have a single, double or triple score

E.g. you can hit: single 20 = 20 points or double 20 = 40 points or triple 20 = 60 points

3) Now, in Double Out, it is required that the last dart hits a Double

3) In one turn, you can score a maximum of 160 points (2x triple 20 + 1x double 20 = 2*60 + 1*40 = 160). Anything higher than 160 is impossible. This doesn't mean anything below 180 IS possible. 179 for example, is impossible as well
